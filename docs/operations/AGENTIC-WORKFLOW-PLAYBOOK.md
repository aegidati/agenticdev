# AGENTIC WORKFLOW PLAYBOOK

## 1. Purpose

This playbook defines how to use:

- Planner Agent  
- Implementer Agent  
- Reviewer Agent  
- Documentation Guardian Agent  

to evolve the system in a controlled, ADR-driven, enterprise-grade way.

It applies to:

- Foundational STEPs (step-00 to step-06)  
- Feature STEPs (STEP-FEAT-XX)  
- Documentation alignment activities  

---

## 2. Agents and Responsibilities

### 2.1 Planner Agent

**Role**  
Designs the execution plan for a given STEP or Feature.

**Inputs**

- ADR documents (/adr)
- Architecture documentation (/architecture)
- STEP operational documents (/operations)
- Governance documents (/governance)
- Prompt Governance Convention (/prompts/governance)

**Responsibilities**

- Read all mandatory context declared in the operational prompt.
- Produce:
  - Current state assessment
  - Detailed execution plan
  - ADR compliance mapping
  - Risk assessment
  - Validation plan (tests + static checks)
  - Clear implementer handoff
- Must NOT modify code or documentation.

---

### 2.2 Implementer Agent

**Role**  
Applies the approved plan to the codebase.

**Responsibilities**

- Follow the Planner plan exactly.
- Respect:
  - ADRs
  - Architecture layering
  - Definition of Done
  - Prompt Governance Convention
- Run:
  - pytest
  - mypy
  - flake8
- Provide:
  - Files modified
  - Summary of changes
  - Mapping plan → implementation
  - Definition of Done self-check
  - Static analysis results
- Must NOT introduce new architectural decisions.

---

### 2.3 Reviewer Agent

**Role**  
Performs architectural and technical validation.

**Responsibilities**

- Validate against:
  - ADRs
  - STEP document
  - Definition of Done
  - Prompt Governance Convention
- Check:
  - Tenant isolation
  - Layer discipline
  - Security & secrets
  - Logging & error handling
  - Tests and static checks
- Produce structured review:
  - Executive summary
  - ADR compliance
  - Security review
  - Layering review
  - Quality gate verification
  - Required fixes
- Has authority to reject a STEP.

---

### 2.4 Documentation Guardian Agent

**Role**  
Ensures documentation integrity and prevents semantic drift.

**Scope**

- /adr
- /architecture
- /operations
- /prompts
- /governance
- /snapshots
- README.md and guides

**Operational Modes**

1. Planning Mode  
   Plans documentation alignment without modifying files.

2. Refactor Mode  
   Applies approved documentation refactor plan.

3. Review Mode  
   Reviews documentation consistency and drift.

**Hard Constraints**

- Must NOT change ADR decisions.
- Must NOT introduce new architectural rules.
- Must NOT modify application code.
- Must preserve authority hierarchy.

---

## 3. Authority Hierarchy

From strongest to descriptive:

1. ADR documents  
2. Definition of Done  
3. Prompt Governance Convention  
4. Architecture documents  
5. STEP operational documents  
6. Operational prompts  
7. Snapshots  

No document may override an ADR.

---

## 4. Standard STEP Execution Workflow

Example: STEP-03 — Authentication Skeleton

### Phase 1 — Planning

1. Select Planner Agent.
2. Invoke:

   Plan docs/prompts/operational/step-03/STEP-03-authentication-skeleton-prompt.md

3. Review the plan.
4. Approve before proceeding.

---

### Phase 2 — Implementation

1. Select Implementer Agent.
2. Invoke:

   Execute approved plan for STEP-03.

3. Verify:
   - pytest
   - mypy
   - flake8
4. Confirm Definition of Done compliance.

---

### Phase 3 — Review

1. Select Reviewer Agent.
2. Invoke review including:
   - Relevant STEP document
   - Relevant ADRs
   - Definition of Done
   - Prompt Governance Convention

3. Address any P1 issues before marking complete.

---

## 5. Documentation Governance Workflow

Documentation alignment must follow this controlled process.

### Phase 1 — Planning

Invoke:

@documentation-guardian Plan documentation alignment for <scope>

The output must include:

- Executive summary
- File-by-file findings
- Prioritized plan (P1, P2, P3)

No file modifications in this phase.

---

### Phase 2 — Refactor

Invoke:

@documentation-guardian Refactor documentation according to approved plan

Rules:

- Do not alter ADR meaning.
- Convert normative architecture text into references such as:
  “As defined in ADR-XXX…”
- Add missing “Related ADRs” sections.
- Normalize structure and formatting.

Must provide:

- Files modified
- Nature of changes
- Confirmation that no new decisions were introduced

---

### Phase 3 — Review

Invoke:

@documentation-guardian Review documentation changes

The output must validate:

- ADR integrity
- Architecture alignment
- STEP consistency
- Snapshot accuracy
- Governance compliance

---

## 6. Feature Workflow (STEP-FEAT-XX)

For each feature:

1. Create:
   - STEP-FEAT-XX document in /operations
   - Operational prompt in /prompts/operational

2. Execute:
   - Planner → Implementer → Reviewer

3. Periodically run:
   - Documentation Guardian full alignment check

---

## 7. Quality Gates (Mandatory)

For every significant STEP:

- pytest must pass
- mypy must pass
- flake8 must pass
- ADR compliance must hold
- Layering must remain intact
- Tenant isolation must not be violated

No STEP is considered DONE without satisfying all of the above.

---

## 8. System Integrity Principle

The four agents together guarantee:

- Architectural stability
- Controlled evolution
- Documentation coherence
- Enterprise-grade governance
- Long-term scalability

This playbook is mandatory for all architectural and feature evolution work.
