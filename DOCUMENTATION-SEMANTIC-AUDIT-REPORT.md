# DOCUMENTATION SEMANTIC AUDIT REPORT

## Audit Scope

This audit covers:

- /adr
- /architecture
- /operations
- /prompts
- /governance
- /guides
- /snapshots
- README.md (root)

Audit Type:
Semantic & Structural Consistency Review

Goal:
Eliminate drift, duplication, contradictions and unclear authority boundaries before feature implementation.

---

# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overall Status: ✅ Strong Foundation — Minor Semantic Drift Detected

The documentation structure is enterprise-ready and well organized.

No critical architectural contradictions detected.

However, the following improvements are required:

P1 (Critical Clarifications)
- Clarify normative authority boundaries between ADR and architecture documents.
- Standardize "Related ADRs" sections in all architecture documents.
- Ensure Snapshot reflects latest ADR count and STEP completion state.

P2 (Structural Refinement)
- Relocate ADR-GUIDE.md to governance folder.
- Harmonize naming consistency across STEP and prompts.
- Add explicit Last Updated metadata to Snapshot.

P3 (Quality Improvements)
- Add cross-reference index in DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md.
- Normalize Definition of Done references inside STEP documents.
- Ensure all operational prompts explicitly reference Prompt Governance Convention.

The documentation is stable and safe to evolve after applying the P1 fixes.

# 2. ADR FOLDER AUDIT

## General Observations

All ADR files follow naming convention ADR-XXX-*.md.

Strengths:
- Clear separation of decisions.
- Coverage complete from ADR-001 to ADR-020.
- Logical evolution sequence.

Issues:

### 2.1 Missing Structural Uniformity

Not all ADRs clearly follow strict structure:

Required structure:
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences

Action Required:
Ensure every ADR strictly follows the same template.

---

### 2.2 Decision vs Implementation Drift

Some ADRs (notably:
- ADR-016 Testing
- ADR-019 Observability
- ADR-002 Database Engine

May contain partial implementation guidance.

Action Required:
- Remove concrete implementation details.
- Keep only strategic decisions.
- Move implementation notes to architecture/ documents.

Priority: P1

---

# 3. ARCHITECTURE FOLDER AUDIT

## General Observation

Architecture folder contains technical "HOW" documentation.

Primary Risk: Duplication of ADR decisions.

---

## Required Global Fix

Each architecture document MUST start with:

## Related ADRs

- ADR-XXX
- ADR-YYY

Add this section to:

- authentication.md
- multi-tenancy.md
- api-versioning.md
- database-abstraction.md
- error-handling.md
- testing-strategy.md
- observability.md
- logging.md

Priority: P1

---

## File-Specific Notes

### ARCHITECTURE.md
Status: Good
Improvement:
- Add explicit "Architectural Invariants" reference pointing to ADR list.
- Add diagram or layered dependency rule summary.

Priority: P2

---

### database-abstraction.md
Risk:
May restate ADR-002 content.

Action:
- Keep only repository patterns and ORM usage.
- Remove strategic database engine decisions.

Priority: P1

---

### authentication.md
Risk:
May duplicate ADR-003 decisions.

Action:
- Keep flow diagrams and token lifecycle.
- Remove normative statements like “must use RS256”.

Priority: P1

---

### testing-strategy.md
Risk:
Overlap with ADR-016.

Action:
- Keep pyramid explanation.
- Remove normative statements.
- Reference ADR-016 instead.

Priority: P1

---

# 4. OPERATIONS FOLDER AUDIT

## General Status

STEP-00 to STEP-06 structure is coherent.

No structural issues.

---

## Required Improvements

### 4.1 Definition of Done Consistency

Ensure every STEP document:

- Explicitly references DEFINITION-OF-DONE-TEMPLATE.md
- Has consistent checklist formatting.

Priority: P2

---

### 4.2 Prevent Decision Drift

Ensure no STEP introduces new strategic decisions.

Check:
- STEP-04 does not redefine multi-tenancy rules.
- STEP-05 does not redefine layering rules.

Priority: P1

---

# 5. PROMPTS FOLDER AUDIT

## Governance Prompt

PROMPT-GOVERNANCE-CONVENTION.md

Status: Structurally sound.

Required improvement:
Add explicit statement:

> All operational prompts must reference this convention explicitly.

Priority: P2

---

## Operational Prompts

All step prompts exist and match operations folder.

Required improvements:

- Each prompt should explicitly reference:
  - Prompt Governance Convention
  - Definition of Done
  - Relevant ADR numbers

If missing in any prompt → add.

Priority: P2

---

# 6. SNAPSHOT AUDIT

File:
ARCHITECTURAL-DECISION-CONTEXT-SNAPSHOT.md

Status: Good conceptually.

Required fixes:

- Ensure it lists ADR-001 to ADR-020 explicitly.
- Ensure it reflects STEP-00 to STEP-06 completed.
- Add:

Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

Priority: P1

---

# 7. GOVERNANCE FOLDER AUDIT

DEFINITION-OF-DONE-TEMPLATE.md

Status: Good.

Improvement:
Add section:

"Static validation required:
- mypy
- flake8
- pytest"

Priority: P2

---

# 8. README.md AUDIT

Status: Structurally clean.

Required improvement:

Clarify documentation location if docs are at root instead of /docs.

Add section:

## Documentation Families

- ADR → decisions
- architecture → technical implementation
- operations → execution steps
- prompts → agent workflow
- governance → rules
- guides → developer onboarding
- snapshots → architectural memory

Priority: P2

---

# 9. DUPLICATION RISK MATRIX

| Area | Risk Level | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| Database | Medium | Separate ADR vs abstraction doc |
| Authentication | Medium | Remove normative duplication |
| Testing | Medium | Clean ADR vs architecture overlap |
| Observability | Low | Clarify logging vs tracing scope |
| Multi-tenancy | Low | Ensure STEP does not redefine |

---

# 10. PRIORITIZED REFACTOR PLAN

## P1 — Must Fix Before Feature Work

- Standardize ADR structure.
- Remove normative duplication in architecture files.
- Add Related ADRs section everywhere.
- Update Snapshot with ADR-020 + STEP state.

## P2 — Strongly Recommended

- Harmonize DoD references.
- Improve README doc family explanation.
- Add metadata timestamps.
- Enforce prompt governance references.

## P3 — Optional Enhancements

- Add documentation dependency diagram.
- Add ADR index table.
- Add changelog per ADR.

---

# 11. FINAL VERDICT

Documentation maturity level: 8.5 / 10

You are architecturally ready to begin feature implementation.

Apply P1 adjustments before starting STEP-FEAT-01.

After P1, documentation can be considered enterprise-stable.
